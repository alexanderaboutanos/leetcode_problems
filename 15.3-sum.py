#
# Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j],
# nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] +
# nums[k] == 0.
#
# Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
# Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = []
# Output: []
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [0]
# Output: []
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 0 <= nums.length <= 3000
# -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
